/**
 * Class that implements the greedy allocation algorithm for cloud scheduling
 * 
 * This scheduler optimizes cloud resource allocation with the following strategies:
 * 1. Allocates tasks to machines based on current utilization and CPU compatibility
 * 2. Migrates tasks from less utilized to more utilized machines to consolidate workloads
 * 3. Powers off unused machines to save energy
 * 4. Handles SLA violations by migrating tasks to less loaded machines
 * 5. Responds to thermal events by adjusting machine workloads
 * 
 * The greedy allocation algorithm prioritizes energy efficiency while maintaining
 * performance by keeping fewer machines active with higher utilization.
